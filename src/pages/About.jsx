            Hello world! My name is Jacob Kachmarek and I am delighted you decided to look at my Portfolio.
            I am recently graduated from the Berkley Coding Bootcamp and am looking to get into the industry. 
            If im not coding I am most likely making music, out watching live music, or staying in playing Counter-Strike.
            I am a lover of good food and beer and residing in Portland, Oregon gives me a plentiful array of choices in that regard. 
            If you are interested in what I have been working on please explore the projects page. Thanks for stopping by!
